# Le moderne.

A modern dark theme for VSCode, made with a subtle blend between **VSCode's Dark Modern** interface and **Atom's One Dark** syntax highlights, with some additional custom tweaks.

## Main features

- **Deep dark interface**: similar to VSCode's Dark Modern theme, Le moderne uses **deep blacks and grays** for the interface background, with **minimal borders**, giving a **modern look**.
- **Colorful Editor**: similar to Atom's One Dark theme, Le moderne provides a **playful color palette for syntax highlighting**, using mainly primary and secondary colors.
- Le moderne strikes a **balance between readability and luminosity**, slightly diming white text in the editor, to avoid eye strain caused by the glare of light text on a dark background.
- Compared to One Dark, Le moderne tends to use **less red in the editor**, to make it less distracting (*NOTE: syntax highlight adjustments were primarily done for the use of **Python**, though the theme should work with other languages with no issue*).

## Credits
This theme could not exist without the original [**One Dark**](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-syntax) made by [Atom](https://github.com/atom) and the VSCode version ([**Atom One Dark**](https://github.com/akamud/vscode-theme-onedark), made by [Mahmoud Ali](https://github.com/akamud)) from which **Le moderne** is greatly inspired.
